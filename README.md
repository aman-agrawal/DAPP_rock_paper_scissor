# Ethereum-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously
forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. Based on the options chosed by participants, a winner
is decided who gets a monetary or ad-hoc reward. The game is often used as a fair choosing method between
two people similar to coin flipping (but not as random)
In this work, we discuss the design and working of a decentralized version of the game using ethereum
blockchain and smart contracts. Just like other popular dapps, itâ€™s power lies in the transparency and
incentivised model of smart contracts

Gameplay
1. A user visits the game URL on Web 3.0 and registers to play the game. In order to register as a player
in the game, he must confirm a payment of 5 ether to the contract.
2. The user then selects a choice (Rock/Paper/Scissors) and enters a private keyphrase, to lock their
choice.
3. When two users are registered and have locked their choices, they claim their choices by entering the
same choice and keyphrase they used while locking.
4. When both users have claimed their choices, the winner gets a financial reward of 9.98 ethers. In case
of a draw, both players receive 4.99 ethers each.
